# Integration Engine

This integration engine began as a learning project to explore various integration patterns and architectural solutions. It is currently under **active development** and is **not production-ready**. Significant changes and improvements are needed before it can be considered stable for production use.

The engine aims to support a wide range of integration patterns and provide core capabilities for transforming, routing, and processing messages between microservices.

Each component within a route can filter messages based on configurable **acceptance** and/or **forwarding policies**:

- An **acceptance policy** determines whether a component will accept a message.
- A **forwarding policy** controls whether the component passes the message to downstream consumers.

Exception handling is under development:

- **Transient errors**, such as certain database exceptions, may trigger automatic retries, assuming the issue could resolve on its own.
- **Non-recoverable errors**, like coding mistakes in transformer, filter, or splitter logic, are not retried and will result in immediate failure.



## Route Configuration
In this engine, routes are configured declaratively by linking various components. The configureRoute() method is where the magic happens, connecting adapters, transformers, filters, and splitters in an intuitive way.

Hereâ€™s an example of how a route can be configured:

```
java

@Override
@PostConstruct
public void configureRoute() throws Exception {
    addInboundFlow(mllpInboundAdapter, transformation, filter);
    addInboundFlow(inboundRouteConnector1, transformation);
    addInternalFlow(transformation, splitter);
    addInternalFlow(filter, splitter);
    addOutboundFlow(splitter, mllpOutboundAdapter);
    addDirectFlow(inboundRouteConnector2, mllpOutboundAdapter);
    
    applyConfiguration();
}
```

- addInboundFlow(): Links inbound components (e.g., adapters, connectors) to the transformation and filtering logic.


- addInternalFlow(): Connects internal components like transformers and splitters.


- addOutboundFlow(): Defines the path to send data to the output (e.g., adapters).


- addDirectFlow(): Establishes a direct flow between inbound and outbound components without any transformations or filters.


## Component Configuration
Each component in the system is configured with annotations. These annotations make it easy to specify component behaviors such as content types, routing policies, and other configuration details.

Example:

```
java

@IntegrationComponent(name = "Allow-only-ADT-A04")
@AcceptancePolicy(name = "acceptADT^A04")
@ForwardingPolicy(name = "forwardAllMessages")
@AllowedContentType(ContentTypeEnum.HL7)
public class Hl7MessageTypeFilter extends BaseFilterProcessingStep {
}


@IntegrationComponent(name = "directory-inbound")
@AdapterOption(key = "idempotent", value = "true")
@AdapterOption(key = "idempotentRepository", value = "#jpaStore")
@AdapterOption(key = "move", value = "processed")
@AdapterOption(key = "noop", value = "false")
@ForwardingPolicy(name = "forwardAllMessages")
@AllowedContentType(ContentTypeEnum.HL7)
public class HL7DirectoryInboundAdapter extends BaseHL7InboundDirectoryAdapter {
 
}

```
This integration engine currently supports the following component types and configuration annotations:

- **Inbound Adapters**


  - MLLP Inbound Adapter  
    - `@ForwardingPolicy`  
    - `@AdapterOption`  
    - `@AllowedContentType`  
    
    

  - SMB Inbound Adapter  
    - `@ForwardingPolicy`  
    - `@AdapterOption`  
    - `@AllowedContentType`  
    



- **Outbound Adapters**


  - MLLP Outbound Adapter  
    - `@AcceptancePolicy`  
    - `@AllowedContentType` 
     
     

  - SMB Outbound Adapter  
    - `@AcceptancePolicy`  
    - `@FileNaming`  
    - `@AllowedContentType`  
    
    


- **Message Handlers**


  - Transformer  
    - `@ForwardingPolicy`  
    - `@AcceptancePolicy`  
    - `@AllowedContentType`  
    - `@UsesTransformer`  
    
    

  - Filter  
    - `@ForwardingPolicy`  
    - `@AcceptancePolicy`  
    - `@AllowedContentType`  
    - `@UsesFilter`  
    
    

  - Splitter  
    - `@ForwardingPolicy`  
    - `@AcceptancePolicy`  
    - `@AllowedContentType`  
    - `@UsesSplitter`  
    
    


- **Route Connectors**


  - Outbound Route Connector  
    - `@StaticDestination`  
    - `@DynamicDestination`

  - Inbound Route Connector  
    - `@From`  
    - `@ForwardingPolicy`
    - `@AllowedContentType`  
    
    
    



- **Route Connectors**

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up a local development environment.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**
- **Java (JDK 17 or higher)**: Required for building the application.
- **Maven**: Required for building the Java project locally.

---

## ðŸš€ Installation

From the **integration** folder

```
mvn clean install
```

Then, navigate to the **integration/config/samples/scripts** folder and run the following:

### First, run these services:

```
run-apache-activemq-artemis
run-apache-ignite
run-mysql
```

### Then, proceed with running the integration services:

```
run-file-input-route
run-file-output-route
run-mllp-input-route
run-mllp-output-route
run-rest-services
```

Please see the individual `README.md` files under `integration/integration-examples` for details on the routes.

### MLLP Sending and Receiving

MLLP communication (sending and receiving HL7 messages) can be easily performed using **SMART HL7 Sender** and **SMART HL7 Receiver**. These tools allow you to send and receive HL7 messages over the MLLP protocol, which is used for healthcare integration.

For more details on setting up and using the SMART HL7 tools, please refer to the respective documentation or setup guides.

### Testing REST Services with Postman

You can interact with and test the REST services provided by the integration engine using **Postman**.
